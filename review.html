                        We had our kitchen cabinets repainted and couldn't be more satisfied with how everything turned out. Andrey was very professional in communicating with us,
                         helping us determine exactly what we wanted in a finished product, fitting us into his already busy schedule and even working around some issues we 
                         had with another project overlapping in his work area that unexpectedly took much longer than anticipated. We especially appreciated his attention to detail,
                         giving a fifth coat of paint to the lower cabinets to ensure they looked perfect, reinstalling the hardware and putting new
                         bumpers on the doors.

                        I decided to completely renovate my kitchen a year ago, and after speaking with several contractors, decided to hire Elena to run the project. 
                        This was the most important first decision of many, and I really glad I found her for the job. Here are some reasons why. 
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Her quote was exact. There were no hidden or surprise fees at the end. I made a couple changes along the way, which she gave me the price for, and I added on. She was flexible in working with changes and her estimates were exact. </li>
                            <li>She has a broad understanding of varying styles. She understood the technical side of the job AND the interior design aspect of the job. Both were important to me, and not all contractors are capable of both (I spoke with several that did not understand the "look" I was going for). </li>
                            <li>The subcontractors that completed the work day-to-day were excellent, friendly, and respectful. I did not mind having them in my house at all.</li>
                            <li>Everything from her end was on time. The project was delayed only because I ordered my appliances a little late. She completed her work as promised, and when my appliances were delayed, she adjusted her schedule to work with me.</li>
                            <li>She worked with my budget. My kitchen looks amazing, is high quality, and was within the reasonable budget I had outlined. Every other contractor I spoke with told me it wouldn't happen. Elena made it happen.</li>
                            <li>I think I may have asked Elena fifty questions a day. Never once did she act annoyed or inconvenienced by my needing clarification or further explanation of the process. She is extremely patient and customer service oriented. </li>
                        </ol>
                        I could really go on and on with examples. Elena was absolutely professional, knowledgeable, and delightful to work with. 
                        I would hire her again in a heartbeat, and highly recommend her, especially to someone who is renovating for the first time.

                                Andrey provided an outstanding service that I didn't think was possible for this project. He was very direct from the beginning, receptive to my questions and concerns, 
                                patient with his explanation, and explained the pros and cons to the different alternatives possible to redo kitchen cabinets. Furthermore, he was very flexible with 
                                scheduling and he went out of his way to accommodate my hectic schedule. Andrey kept my kitchen clean throughout the entire process from start to finish; 
                                and I love the outcome of his work. I highly recommend Andrey and I know he will do the right thing for his current and future customers.

                                    were best for us. The contract included ALL additional work, so we had no surprises during the project. She was incredibly clear in all of her
